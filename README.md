# Business-networks
This project is the result of my master's thesis which investigates the phenomenon of business networks in Italy. I graduated from the University of Tuscia on 15th February 2023.  


#Heterogeneity and Geographical Location in Italian Business Networks


More updated results of my master's thesis work are published in Jounal of Industrial and business economics   

Nota bene:
The file may be a little messy because this is my first project and not all the information or files are uploaded because I can upload only 25MB each time. If you have some difficulties, don't hesitate to contact me.
